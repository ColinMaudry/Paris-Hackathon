# LOS Paris Hackathon: “Consume” track

The “Consume” track is about using statistical linked data (or metadata). It will start Wednesday at 9:00 AM and end on Friday noon.

## Activities

Here is a non-limitative list of possible activities during the hackathon:
  * Create data visualisation on RDF statistical datasets;
  * Create explore and query tools for RDF statistical datasets, for example based on metadata;
  * Develop APIs on top of RDF statistical datasets.

In order to prepare for this track, it is recommended that the participants get familiar with the SPARQL query language. The [Models page](../models/models-vocabularies.md) lists useful resources about SPARQL.
