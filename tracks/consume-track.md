# LOS Paris Hackathon: “Consume” track

The “Consume” track is about using statistical linked data (or metadata). It will start Wednesday at 9:00 AM and end on Friday noon.

## Activities

Here is a non-limitative list of possible activities during the hackathon:
  * Create data visualisation on RDF statistical datasets;
  * Create explore and query tools for RDF statistical datasets, for example based on metadata;
  * Develop APIs on top of RDF statistical datasets.

In order to prepare for this track, it is recommended that the participants get familiar with the SPARQL query language. The [Models page](../models/models-vocabularies.md) lists useful resources about SPARQL.

## Agenda

The detailed agenda is indicated below. Please note that coffee will be provided at the start of each morning and afternoon session.

## Suggestions

Here are some detailed suggestions in case you need inspiration.

### French Census data

A lot of French census data has been converted to RDF. They are available via the following links:

 * [POP5](http://graphdb.linked-open-statistics.org/) (repository: pop5)

 * [Legal populations 2010-2015](http://rdf.insee.fr/sparql) (graphs http://rdf.insee.fr/graphes/demo/popleg2010 to http://rdf.insee.fr/graphes/demo/popleg2015)

### NUTS with contours

The European NUTS with their WKT contours are available at: http://graphdb.linked-open-statistics.org/ (repository: nuts)

### Public SPARQL endpoints

[DBpedia](https://dbpedia.org/sparql) and [Wikidata](https://query.wikidata.org/) endpoints are always good places to test your SPARQL skills.
