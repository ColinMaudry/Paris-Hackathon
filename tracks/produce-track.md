## Suggestions

Here are some detailed suggestions in case you need inspiration.

### French Census data

An [example program](https://github.com/LOS-ESSnet/POP5) is provided that converts results from the French Census (the ‘POP5’ spreadsheet) into a Data Cube DSD and DataSet. You can try to adapt the program to [other Census data sets](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3561090?sommaire=3561107), or to [previous years](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2053581?sommaire=2118618) (for methodological reasons, you can only compare results that are separated by five years).


### Data Cube DSDs

You can create Data Structure Definitions for new multi-dimensional data sets using the DSD Editor (see the [Tools page](../tools/tools.md)).
