The two main packages for the manipulation of RDF data are Apache Jena and Eclipse RDF4J.

### Apache Jena

Jena (https://jena.apache.org/) is a top-level project of the Apache foundation, and actively developed under its auspices.

The [Getting started](https://jena.apache.org/getting_started/index.html) page gives an overview of the library structure and links to interesting tutorials and documentations.

To use Jena in a Maven project, just add a [dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.jena/apache-jena-libs) on the `apache-jena-libs` artifact ([more detail here](https://jena.apache.org/download/maven.html)).
