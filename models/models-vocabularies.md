# LOS Paris Hackathon: standards, models and vocabularies


This page lists the different standards, models and vocabulary that could be useful for the hackathon.

## RDF / OWL

The W3C [RDF Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) is a very good and accessible introduction to RDF. It is highly recommended to read it before the hackathon.

The [OWL Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) is for more advanced users who wish to get familiar with OWL constructs.

## Data Cube

All participants of the “Produce” track that intend to convert or create dimensional data (tables, cubes or hypercubes) should read the [Data Cube](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) specification. Data Cube is based on the SDMX data model: a good [SDMX tutorial](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdmx-infospace/trainings-tutorials/tutorials) is provided by Eurostat.

## SPARQL

For participants of the “Consume” track, SPARQL will be the most useful thing to know. The Jena documentation includes a [SPARQL tutorial](https://jena.apache.org/tutorials/sparql.html), translated in French [here](https://web-semantique.developpez.com/tutoriels/jena/arq/introduction-sparql/). For more in-depth information, the [SPARQL Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) specification is the place to go.

## SKOS / XKOS

SKOS is the RDF standard for publishing concept schemes, terminologies, taxonomies, code lists, etc. The [SKOS Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) describes the main characteristics of this model. [XKOS](http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/RDF/XKOS) extends SKOS in order to represent statistical classifications.

## DCAT and application profiles

[DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/), the Data Catalog Vocabulary, is a W3C Recommendation defining a model for the documentation of datasets published on the web. It is extended into specific profiles for statistical and geographic data sets, respectively [StatDCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/statdcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe) and [GeoDCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/geodcat-ap/v101).

## Other vocabularies

Some of the suggested hackathon activities may involve the use of other W3C Recommendations, for example [PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/), a model for provenance metadata, or the [ORG](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/), a vocabulary for representing organizational structures.
