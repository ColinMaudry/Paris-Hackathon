# LOS Paris Hackathon: data set description template #


This template should be used to describe the data sets that will be made available before or during the hackathon. The template is loosely based on the [StatDCAT application profile](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/statdcat-ap-v100). In particular, each description is split between a "dataset" part, which lists the general characteristics, and a "distribution" part which describes the physical data set provided for the hackathon.

All string properties should be provided at least in English, but additional values can be given for other languages.

The [Data sets](datasets.md) page references the descriptions of the data sets made available for the hackathon.
